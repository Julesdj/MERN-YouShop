# MERN-YouShop

YouShop is our submission for the MERN Stack project. It's an online E-Commerce website much like Amazon, Etsy, and Ebay. You can updated and delete products. Also this website has many different pages with good styling. The concept is that of a website that's products channel your interests and lifestyle better. For this website we mostly used react-bootstrap and react-router-dom. React-bootstrap is a very useful tool, and it helped us create a functional and well styled Navbar.

With contributions from Kokutse Djoguenou, Shawn Greene, and Connor Kline.

# Challenges Faced

The implementation of some of the style elements used in our Figma mockup. Shawn Greene did a good amount of the Figma part, though some features couldn't be put in due to constraints.

In the future, when submitting something like this to employers we'd like to go back and add some of the features that would really differentiate this from other online E-Commerce websites in the space. Initial ideas proposed at the beginning of the project included things such as having an interest quiz available and tags on every product and storefront which took from that quiz's answers.

# Getting Started
